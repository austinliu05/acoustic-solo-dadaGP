## Background & Attribution

This repo is a **fork** of [dadaGP](https://github.com/dada-bots/dadaGP) by `dada-bots`.

---

## What's Changed

- **Enhanced Acoustic Support**: Optimized for acoustic solo guitar files
- **Alternative Tunings**: Full support for various guitar tunings including Celtic tuning
- **Multi-track Processing**: Support for up to 3 clean/acoustic guitar tracks
- **Command Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI for file processing
- **Improved Token Processing**: Better handling of acoustic-specific musical elements

---

## Features

- **Guitar Pro File Processing**: Convert `.gp3`, `.gp4`, `.gp5`, and `.gpx` files to tokenized format
- **Alternative String Tunings**: Support for various guitar tunings (standard, drop D, Celtic, etc.)
- **Multi-track Support**: Handle multiple acoustic guitar tracks (up to 3)
- **Token-based Processing**: Advanced token system for representing musical elements
- **Track Merging**: Merge multiple tracks into a single representation
- **File Validation**: Validate Guitar Pro files for compatibility
- **Comprehensive CLI**: Full command-line interface for all operations

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install acoustic-solo-dadaGP
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austinliu05/acoustic-solo-dadaGP.git
cd acoustic-solo-dadaGP
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The package provides a comprehensive CLI with the following commands:

#### Encode Guitar Pro to Tokens

```bash
asdadagp encode input.gp5 output.txt --artist "Artist Name"
```

#### Decode Tokens to Guitar Pro

```bash
asdadagp decode input.txt output.gp5
```

#### Process Tokens

```bash
# Process with track merging
asdadagp process input.txt --merge-tracks --output processed.txt

# Process as acoustic solo
asdadagp process input.txt --acoustic-solo --output processed.txt

# Keep tracks separate
asdadagp process input.txt --no-merge-tracks --output processed.txt
```

#### Merge Tracks

```bash
# Merge multiple tracks into a single representation
asdadagp merge-tracks input.txt output.txt
```

**What it does:**
- Removes `cleanX:` prefixes from tokens (e.g., `clean0:note:s6:f0:D3` â†’ `note:s6:f0:D3`)
- Combines multiple guitar tracks into a unified tab
- Preserves all musical content (notes, effects, timing)

#### Split Measures

```bash
# Split tokens into measures with structured output
asdadagp split-measures input.txt output.json
```

**What it does:**
- Splits tokens by `new_measure` boundaries
- Outputs structured JSON with:
  - `tokens`: Indexed mapping of all tokens
  - `measure_order`: Lists of token indices for each measure
  - `tuning`: Guitar string tuning information

#### Get File Information

```bash
# Guitar Pro file info
asdadagp info input.gp5

# Token file info
asdadagp info input.txt
```



### Python API

```python
from asdadagp import asdadagp_decode, asdadagp_encode, process_tokens

# Encode a Guitar Pro file
asdadagp_encode("input.gp5", "output.txt", "Artist Name")

# Decode tokens back to Guitar Pro
asdadagp_decode("input.txt", "output.gp5")

# Process tokens
processed = process_tokens(tokens, merge_tracks=True)
```

---

## Command Line Interface

### Available Commands

- **`encode`**: Convert Guitar Pro files to token format
- **`decode`**: Convert tokens back to Guitar Pro files
- **`process`**: Process tokens with various options
- **`merge-tracks`**: Merge multiple tracks in a token file
- **`split-measures`**: Split tokens into measures with structured output
- **`info`**: Display information about files

### Examples

```bash
# Basic encoding
asdadagp encode song.gp5 tokens.txt --artist "John Doe"

# Decoding with custom output
asdadagp decode tokens.txt output.gp5

# Process tokens and save to file
asdadagp process tokens.txt --merge-tracks --output processed.txt

# Merge multiple tracks in a token file
asdadagp merge-tracks input.txt output.txt

# Split tokens into measures with structured output
asdadagp split-measures input.txt output.json

# Get detailed file information
asdadagp info song.gp5
```
